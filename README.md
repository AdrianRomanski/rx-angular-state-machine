### rx-angular-state-machine

Running Project - ***npm run start-wow***

This repository demonstrates a state management pattern using Rx Angular integrated with State Machines. 

It follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Layered Architecture, and implements the Facade Pattern to ensure clean code and separation of concerns.

Features
<br> ***State Machine***: Manages state transitions in a structured way.
<br> ***RxAngular***: Handles asynchronous operations and reactive state management.
<br> ***Facade*** Pattern: Provides a clean API to interact with state logic.
<br> ***DDD***: Separates business logic into well-defined domains.
<br> ***Layered Architecture***: Organizes the app into layers (presentation, domain, infrastructure).
<br> ***Modal Management***: Efficient handling of modal dialogs.
